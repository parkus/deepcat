Deepcat is a data structure for storing measurements of the properties of objects. Catalogs of stars are what I had in mind. This supercedes my SciCatalog code.

Deepcat is made to accommodate multiple measurements of the same property, including the uncertainty on each measurement and reference for that measurement. It is intended for catalogs of up to a few hundred, maybe a few thousand objects. After that, I suspect it will scale poorly because it does not use arrays. The tradeoff is that it is flexible and extensible. For example, you could add an attribute to a measurement that gives the date it was made or add a detailed posterior distribution. Just note that these must be json serializable if you want to be able to save the data without modifying the Deepcat code.

Deepcat is intended to be used with Git or similar for version tracking, collaborating, and backup. It will save its output into a directory as a .json file for each object in the catalog. Users should initialize that directory as a Git repository and commit changes as they see fit.
